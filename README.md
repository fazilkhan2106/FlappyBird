# Flappy Bird

Welcome to the **Flappy Bird** game created using Java! This project is a recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game where the player controls a bird, navigating it through a series of obstacles.

## Description

**Flappy Bird** is a simple yet addictive game where you guide a small bird through a series of pipes without crashing. The game gets progressively harder as you score more points. The main objective is to score as high as possible by making the bird fly between the gaps of the pipes. This project demonstrates the use of basic Java concepts like object-oriented programming, graphics, and event handling.

## Gameplay
